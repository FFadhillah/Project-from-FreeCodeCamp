        <li>48 g (1 ½ fl oz) whole milk add more if necessary</li>

        <li>120 g (1 c) powdered sugar add more if necessary</li>

        <li>1 tsp strawberry preserves or jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mxing bowl combine the dry ingredients, the 150 g mochiko flour, 115 g tapioca starch, 
            8 g baking powder, and .8 g salt then mix.</li>
        <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, cream the 75 g white granulated sugar and 24 g vegetable shortening 
            until incorporated. Add 1 large egg and mix thoroughly. Add ⅔ of the milk and stir until combined. 
            Reserve the other 1/3 of the milk to adjust consistency later.</li>
        <li>Sift HALF the dry ingredients into the liquid bowl. Use a spatula to mix the ingredients. 
            Repeat with the second half of dry ingredients and stir again.</li>
        <li>Consistency check: The batter should have a “drop batter” consistency. This means that when you lift 
            the batter with a spatula above the bowl, it keeps its overall shape and very slowly drops back into the bowl. 
            And when you stir the batter, it should pull slightly from the sides of the bowl.
If your     batter is too thick, add some or all of the milk we set aside earlier and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Let the batter rest on the counter for 30 minutes so the flour and rest and hydrate.</li>
    </ol>
